The character, boundaries, chocolate, and Chris are represented as *, #, !, and C respectively. 
The objective of the game is to collect all ten chocolates while you try to survive the pop quizzes
thrown at you randomly. The answers are randomly generated, so you must try to guess the right answer. 
After collecting 5 and 10 chocolates, you level up to 2 and 3 respectively. Once you reach level 3, you need to
deliver the chocolates to Chris. Each level has a different map and the damage power of the quizzes increase each level.
